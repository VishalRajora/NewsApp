## Built with

- **Kotlin** - As a programming language.
- **Coroutines** - For multithreading while handling requests to the server and local database.
- **Navigation Component** - To handle app navigation.
- **Multidex** - To enable creating multi dex files because of using set of libraries that reached the maximum size of single dex file.
- **Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM)** - Offers an implementation of observer design pattern.
- **LiveData** - Notifies views of any database changes in an observer way.
- **Kotlin flows** - Flow is the Kotlin type that can be used to model streams of data. Just like LiveData and RxJava streams.
- **Retrofit** - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java
- **Coil** -An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines. Coil is:
- **Timber** - It helps in logging while debugging your app. and all logging code will not be embedded in the released APK.
- **Hilt** - It is arguably the most used Dependency Injection, or DI, framework for Android. Many Android projects use Dagger to simplify building and providing dependencies across the app. It gives you the ability to create specific scopes, modules, and components, where each forms a piece of a puzzle: The dependency graph.
